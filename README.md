# SimpleGame1
This is a simple game that I made in python with Ursina Engine.

This game requires python3 and Ursina Engine

To Install The Requirements:
  On Ubuntu/Debian based systems:
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install ursina
  On Redhat/CentOS based systems:
    sudo yum install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install ursina
  On Fedora Linux based systems:
    sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install ursina

On Windows, install python 3.9 in the Windows Store, then open cmd and type:
  pip3 install ursina

If you are on linux go into the Engine folder and then execute the file called "main.py".
If you are on windows, execute the "RunGame.bat" file.
